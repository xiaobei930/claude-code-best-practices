# CC-Best

> Role-driven Claude Code development workflow plugin.

CC-Best transforms Claude Code into a complete development team with role-based workflows (PM → Lead → Designer → Dev → QA), safety hooks, and a self-evolving knowledge pipeline.

## Overview

- Name: cc-best
- Version: 0.7.4
- License: MIT
- Homepage: https://xiaobei930.github.io/cc-best/
- Repository: https://github.com/xiaobei930/cc-best

## Components

- 44 commands (role, mode, build, git, context, quality, ops, setup)
- 18 skills (backend, frontend, testing, security, architecture, devops, git, learning)
- 8 agents (architect, planner, code-reviewer, code-simplifier, security-reviewer, tdd-guide, build-error-resolver, requirement-validator)
- 33 rules across 8 directories (common + python, frontend, java, csharp, cpp, embedded, ui)
- 21 hook scripts across 8 lifecycle events (17 registered in hooks.json)

## Key Concepts

### Role Pipeline
PM → Lead → Designer → Dev → QA → Verify → Commit
Each role has MUST/SHOULD/NEVER boundaries and creates numbered documents (REQ-XXX → DES-XXX → TSK-XXX).

### Autonomous Decision Principles (A1-A5)
- A1: Context inference (don't interrupt to ask)
- A2: Decision recording (rationale + confidence)
- A3: Downstream correction (Lead reviews PM, QA classifies bugs)
- A4: MVP fallback (minimal viable approach when uncertain)
- A5: Issue classification (implementation bugs vs requirement assumption errors)

### Three Development Modes
- `/cc-best:iterate` — Fully autonomous development loop
- `/cc-best:pair` — Step-by-step collaboration with confirmation checkpoints
- `/cc-best:cc-ralph` — Long-running loop (requires ralph-loop plugin)

### Knowledge Evolution Pipeline
observe (hook) → analyze (command) → learn (command) → evolve (command)

### Dao-Fa-Shu-Qi Philosophy (道法术器)
Four-layer architecture: Philosophy → Method → Practice → Tools
